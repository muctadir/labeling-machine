                <h5 id="q-goal">(1) What is the goal?</h5>
                <p>The goal of the paper is categorizing documentation issues in order to define a research agenda for
                    the SE community. The classification is done at sentence level, so for a single artefact we can have
                    multiple dimensions classified with multiple tags</p>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="q-whichSentence">(2) Which “sentences” should be labeled?</h5>
                <p>The sentences of interest are those related to the five dimension we classify: issue, solution,
                    actor, type, tool. </p>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="q-fp">(3) When to mark as “False Positive”?</h5>
                <p>if an artifact (1) is empty , or (2) is not related to a documentation issue, we classify it as false
                    positive, otherwise we proceed in the classification.</p>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="q-verification">(4) When to mark as "Needs verification”?</h5>
                <p>to mark something that is worth discussing between us once the first set of documents has been
                    tagged. so it is not like "I will visit this tag later" and it’s to mark it in the database as in
                    need for further check/discussion</p>


                <hr>
                <h5 id="q-solution">(5) Thinking about the "solution"? Is it about the solution described in the
                    artifact? or is it about the solution we propose?</h5>
                <p>We do not propose or guess. We are labelling what is in the artefact.</p>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="example1">(6) GitHub issue:
                    <pre style="display: inline">'Add example to serializer component docs'</pre>
                    . To me it looks simple: issue: missing example, solution: add example. but since we have predefined
                    tags, it falls under completeness(?), so I should use that?
                </h5>
                <br>
                <p>We can follow the following practice to keep hierarchies: "Completeness: Missing working
                    examples".</p>

                <hr>
                <h5 id="vs">(7) What's the difference btw *User guide* and *Developer Guide*?</h5>
                <p>If the tool is an API, the users and developers are the same. if the tool is a system, users and
                    developers are different. User manual can be also technical (like the guide for installing
                    haddop)</p>
